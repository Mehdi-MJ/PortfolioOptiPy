# PortfolioOptiPy

This project is a Streamlit web app that lets you explore live stock data, portfolio risk, and optimization all in one place.
It pulls real-time data from Yahoo Finance and uses Python’s data science stack to give you clear insights into performance, diversification, and portfolio efficiency.

I created this app to combine financial analytics with data visualization a hands-on way to explore how portfolio theory works with live market data.
It’s also a foundation for more advanced features like risk modeling, backtesting, or live strategy tracking.

I will keep implenting new features and adjusting assumptions and models with time.
